# About the Project
Depression detection using audio files in Python using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the DAIC-WOZ dataset is a project that aims to detect depression in individuals based on their speech patterns. The DAIC-WOZ dataset is a collection of audio and video recordings of interviews between patients and mental health professionals.

The project begins by pre-processing the audio files to extract relevant features, such as pitch, energy, and formants. The pre-processed features are then used to train a CNN model using Keras and TensorFlow. The model includes several layers of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers, with activation functions and regularization techniques applied to prevent overfitting.

Once the model is trained, it is used to predict the depression levels of individuals based on their speech patterns. The project includes a user interface where users can upload an audio file of their speech, and the model will predict their depression level.

Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in accurately detecting depression in individuals based on their speech patterns. The use of the DAIC-WOZ dataset provides a large and diverse set of audio recordings that can be used to train and test the model, and the user interface makes it easy for individuals to receive an initial assessment of their depression level.
